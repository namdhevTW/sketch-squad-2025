# ADR-000: Automated Interview Scheduling System

## Date:
2025-03-18

## Status:
Proposed

## Context:
Currently, interview scheduling is handled manually, leading to inefficiencies such as scheduling conflicts, communication delays, and increased administrative workload. We need an automated system to streamline the process, reduce errors, and improve the candidate experience.
Decision

## Decision:
We will implement an automated interview scheduling system that integrates with calendar APIs (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook), provides real-time availability checks, and sends automated notifications and reminders.
Consequences

## Consequences:
- ✅ Reduces scheduling conflicts by checking real-time availability.
- ✅ Saves time by automating email notifications and reminders.
- ✅ Improves candidate experience with self-scheduling options.
- ✅ Enables easy rescheduling and cancellation.
- ⚠️ Requires integration with multiple calendar services.
- ⚠️ May need to handle time zone differences carefully.

## Alternatives Considered:
  Manual Scheduling with Email Templates – Less development effort but still time-consuming.
  Third-Party Scheduling Tools (e.g., Calendly, Microsoft Bookings) – Quick to implement but may have limitations in customization.
  Custom Web Application – Fully tailored but requires significant development time.
