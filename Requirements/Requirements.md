# Interview Scheduling Chatbot System Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for developing a chatbot-assisted system to streamline the interview scheduling process for Thoughtworks recruiters.
The system aims to solve challenges in interviewer identification, availability management, scheduling coordination, systems integration, and reporting capabilities.

Thoughtworks recruiters currently face significant challenges in efficiently scheduling technical interviews due to the manual and fragmented nature of the process.
This results in time-consuming coordination, scheduling conflicts, double-bookings, and lack of visibility into interviewer availability.
